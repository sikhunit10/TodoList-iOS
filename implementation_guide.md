# Implementation Guide

## 1. Project Setup
- Create new Xcode project: iOS App with SwiftUI interface
- Enable CoreData during project creation
- Configure deployment targets: iOS 16+ (for iPhone and iPad)
- Add necessary capabilities in Xcode:
  - iCloud (CloudKit)
  - Background Modes (for sync)
  - Push Notifications (optional)

## 2. CoreData Model Setup
- Define `Task` entity with attributes:
  - id (UUID)
  - title (String)
  - taskDescription (String)
  - dueDate (Date, optional)
  - priority (Integer)
  - isCompleted (Boolean)
  - dateCreated (Date)
  - dateModified (Date)
  - categoryID (UUID, optional)

- Define `Category` entity:
  - id (UUID)
  - name (String)
  - colorHex (String)
  - tasks (Relationship to Task)

## 3. CloudKit Integration
- Setup CloudKit container in iCloud dashboard
- Implement `CloudKitService` to handle:
  - User permission requests
  - Record mapping between CoreData and CloudKit
  - Sync operations (push/pull)
  - Conflict resolution strategy

## 4. Data Controller 
- Create `DataController` class to manage:
  - CoreData stack initialization
  - CRUD operations
  - Save context operations
  - Fetch requests with predicates
  - iCloud sync integration

## 5. SwiftUI Views
- Main task list with filtering options
- Task detail view
- Add/edit task form with validation
- Category management
- Settings view with sync preferences
- iPad-specific layouts using GeometryReader and conditionals

## 6. Sync Logic
- Implement two-way sync between local store and iCloud
- Handle user permission flow with appropriate messaging
- Implement conflict resolution strategy (last-modified wins)
- Add background sync capabilities
- Provide visual indicators for sync status

## 7. Testing Considerations
- Unit tests for core business logic
- UI tests for critical user flows
- iCloud sync testing across devices
- Offline mode testing
- Performance testing with large data sets
